########## COMPILE ###########
##############################

To compile, you will need GNU C compiler 'gcc' and all standard libraries 
installed. The gcc version we tested with is 3.2.2 but it should be able to 
work with any other versions, too.

At the prompt:
 gcc check_es11.c -o check_es11

This will create the executable 'check_es11'. Place this executable into your
plugins directory. (For Nagios, this is usually /usr/local/nagios/libexec )

########## BASIC USAGE #######
##############################

To use the plugin: 
 check_es11 [hostname] [W/R] [6-digit Device ID]

W is for Flood Sensor Status
R is for resetting the latch after a "Wet" status is detected and latched. It is
  ignored if the ES11 was not setup to latch on Wet status (see the manual on how
  to latch Wet status).

If you enter only the hostname and nothing else, then the output will be data from
the Websensor. However, it is not recommended to use this plugin to obtain HVAC
data from the Websensor itself. Use the check_em01.c plugin instead.
  
Examples:
This will return ES11 data: 
 check_es11 192.168.0.2 W 300100
Sample Output:
 OK ES11 Water Sensor Dry

This will reset the latch:
 check_es11 192.168.0.2 R 300100
Sample Output:
 Latch Reset. Water Sensor Now Dry

########## NAGIOS INSTALLATION ######
#####################################
Requirements:
 EM01B and ES06 Websensor deployed on your network
 ES11 plugin script (check_es11.c)
 GNU C compiler (GCC) version 3 and above.
 Nagios version 2.7 (this guide can also be used for Nagios version 1.x)

1. Compile the plugin script using gcc
    $ gcc check_es11.c 뻩 check_es11
2. Copy the script to Nagios plugins directory. 
   The default is /usr/local/nagios/libexec but may vary according to 
   your installation.
3. Copy the configuration file (es11.cfg) to your Nagios 
   configuration directory. The default is /usr/local/nagios/etc.
4. Edit main Nagios configuration file. Usually, this is the file nagios.cfg:
    $ vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
   Add the following lines to your main configuration file
    # Esensors configuration files
    cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/esensors.cfg
	cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/websensors.cfg
	cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/es11.cfg
5. Edit es11.cfg file:
    $ vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/es11.cfg
   . You may edit the Sensor Polling Services command arguments to reflect your
     deployment environment (i.e. set low/high thresholds for alerts to be sent)
6. Retart Nagios
    $ service nagios restart
Alternatively, you may execute the following commands too:
    $ kill `cat /usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.lock`
    $ /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -d /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
7. Verify that the ES06 appears as a service in your Nagios website.
   
   
########## DEBUGGING #########
##############################

If you are having trouble with the plugin, you can try to debug it.
Edit the file check_em01.c and change line #3 from '#undef' to '#define'

1	/* Print Debug Info....
2	
3	#define DEBUG
4	...

Now compile the program according to the instructions above.
Run the plugin again to see details on where the plugin is failing and why.
If you still have trouble with this plugin, please feel free to contact us.
